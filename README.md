This is my first PHP project, if there are bugs let me know.
Also, this project is free to use meaning that you can use this anywhere you want, even in commercial work.

# What the files do (so you don't accidentally break the thing)
config.php:
  This file contains the config. Self explanatory name.
index.php:
  Contains the boring login stuff. Do **not** change this part unless you know what you're doing.
templates/:
  This folder contains the login form and dashboard. You can change it as much as you want.
.htaccess:
  This is the server configuration file. Here's a tutorial about what it is: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/htaccess.html
