This is my first PHP project, if there are bugs let me know.<br/>
Also, this project is free to use meaning that you can use this anywhere you want, even in commercial work.<br/>

# What the files do (so you don't accidentally break the thing)<br/>
config.php:<br/>
  This file contains the config. Self explanatory name.<br/>
index.php:<br/>
  Contains the boring login stuff. Do **not** change this part unless you know what you're doing.<br/>
templates/:<br/>
  This folder contains the login form and dashboard. You can change it as much as you want.<br/>
.htaccess:<br/>
  This is the server configuration file. Here's a tutorial about what it is: https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/howto/htaccess.html<br/>
